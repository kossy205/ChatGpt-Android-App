# ChatGpt-Android-App

In the "ServiceBuilder" file, make sure you replace "<your api key>" with your own unique key

An android app built with kotlin driven by the famous AI technology chatGpt that imitates human text and can provide answers to questions from a wide variety of topics. 

My approach for integrating the OpenAI API with this Android Kotlin application is the Retrofit library. It involves utilizing the features provided by Retrofit to facilitate HTTP requests and response handling, allowing for seamless interaction with the OpenAI API.
